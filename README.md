# WWLite *

\* temporary name

This is a prototype Mac app for downloading and watching WWDC videos. This is just a quick hack at the moment, but maybe I'll make something more from it.

## Why?

Because the official Catalyst app is shit and the popular unofficial one has some issues on my computer, and I wanted to watch some videos, so I had to built my own ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

## Details

**Tech**: SwiftUI + AppKit + duct tape

**What works**: Showing a badly ordered list of videos, downloading, showing ones already downloaded in the WWDC folder, playing videos inline in a standard player.

**What doesn't work**: any kind of data persistence, favoriting, tracking state, iCloud sync, sorting, filtering, player controls, good design/UX, dark mode.
